# Books - Codeforces
My approach to solve the task from [Codeforces website](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/279/B?locale=en).
Program made in Java with the use of Maven.

# Needed input
When started, program will ask for giving it number of books to be read, amount of users free time and then the time
each book takes to be read. Program will do the rest of the job.

# Environment versions
* JDK 17.03 LTS
* Apache Maven 3.8.5
